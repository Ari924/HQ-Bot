# HQ-Bot
A python script that automatically grabs questions and answers from HQ trivia running on an Android device.
Requires a batch file or script to initialise a screen grab of the phone (Boxcutter on Windows) as well as an OCR tool (Tesseract works well but could be faster if set up to run on GPU).
